		"Hm?": "",
		"How did you get here?": "",
		"Well, this place is pretty undiscoverable by default. Did you perchance go into a black hole?": "",
		"Uh, I guess? Seems like this place is a solar system cutoff from the universe.": "",
		"Well no kidding. Say, you're the one with the ship here, so may I ask you a favor?": "",
		"Yeah, sure, what is it?": "",
		"So, long story short, I was whizzing around the outer solar system, when suddenly I crash into some ghostly planet.": "",
		"How were you not trapped there?": "",
		"Well, you see, the back end of my ship got lodged in there, while the front half got sent flying forward. Somehow, I crashed near here.": "",
		"Okay, so what's the favor?": "",
		"Get my radio from that ghostly moon. It's urgent.": "",
		"...": "",
		"Oh, right. I spotted a tall tower of unknown height on that gold-looking planet not long ago. That may get you somewhere.": "",
		"Thanks.": "",
		"I already went there?": "",
		"Oh, sorry, haha! I'm old, my memory is a little fuzzy.": "",
		"Feldspar?!": "",
		"Feldspar? Haha, that's the funniest thing I've ever heard!": "",
		"Not really. I've heard it a million times.": "",
		"Feldpar is my 2nd cousin. We just so happen to look alike.": "",
		"Oh.": "",
		"I found something!": "",
		"Oh? Go on, tell me. It just might spark my curiosity.": "",
		"I found a Nomai colony on that golden moon.": "",
		"Oh, there is? Wonder how they got there.": "",
		"Probably used it for mining or something.": "",
		"Eh, who knows? Let me know if you find anything else.": "",
		"They did actually use it for mining. So,": "",
		"There was a huge tower on the golden moon.": "",
		"Really? Can't imagine how tall it is.": "",
		"What was it used for?": "",
		"Something about a ghost moon and some strange property.": "",
		"Ghost moon? Sounds crazy. But there has been wandering moon around here.": "",
		"Wouldn't doubt what the Nomai are saying is true.": "",
		"Huh.": "",
		"In fact, I actually crashed into that ghost moon, or at least I think so.": "",
		"I was in the outer solar system, so...": "",
		"How did you not get trapped?": "",
		"I found a black hole that takes you to the core of Helioplasmia.": "",
		"Oh really? You can't just fly down there yourself? Why and where would you need a black hole?": "",
		"The core of Helioplasmia is completely shut off from the world.": "",
		"Wait... then how did you get... out?": "",
		"Uh... Anyways! The black hole was in a building on an asteroid colony. It was to access the Ghost Moon.": "",
		"Ah, another Ghost Moon predicament, eh? They sure are persistent.": "",
		"So,": "",
		"The Nomai built some kind of gateway on Zephyria.": "",
		"Gateway? I wouldn't doubt they were trying to leave this place.": "",
		"Trying to leave? Leaving is easy!": "",
		"Easy? Pfft, entering this place is a one-way trip to purgatory!": "",
		"What? I can just teleport out.": "",
		"Oh, you can teleport out, but the Nomai didn't have whatever warp tech you have.": "",
		"Eh, fair enough. So,": "",
		"I landed on a huge space station.": "",
		"Huge space station? What purpose would a space station have for the Nomai?": "",
		"Apparently it was constructed mainly to experiment on...": "",
		"Let me guess, the Ghost Moon?": "",
		"Yup.": "",
		"Was there anything else there?": "",
		"Like some kind of clue or what not?": "",
		"There was a wall with letters on it. A Nomai also mentioned how he scattered words tied to those letters across this system.": "",
		"Hmm. Actually, you might be best checking the houses behind me. I think I saw a strange pile of rocks in one of them.": "",
		"Thanks!": "",
		"I managed to land on the Ghost Moon!": "",
		"What!? You managed to do it?": "",
		"Did you find my radio?": "",
		"I sure did. But I couldn't pick it up. It was glued to the ground.": "",
		"Well, thanks for going out to find it anyway.": "",
		"Even if you couldn't pick it up, I still appreciate you.": "",
		"Thanks. So,": "",
		"No, unfortunately. I didn't see it anywhere.": "",
		"Aw, that's too bad.": "",
		"Sorry.": "",
		"See you later.": "",
		"Ok, see you around, pal.": "",

		"Recorder": "",
		"My name is Nylox. I don't know how anybody would have gotten here, consider yourself lucky.": "",
		"Our ship randomly exploded without reason.": "",
		"Some supernatural force is at play here. We are destined to die here. If you are translating this, know this: ": "",
		"I have installed buttons on this recorder with the help of my friend Quiax.": "",
		"Each button does something different. It will give all the information I know.": "",
		"The Ghost Moon, to my knowledge, is an object comprised of 4D matter.": "",
		"When it moves around the system, it changes size as it moves across the 4th dimension into our plane of existence.": "",
		"However, when it is in this position, it is perfectly aligned with the 3rd dimension. ": "",
		"The 4D matter is what kills living beings. You can't see it... but it's there. And it's deadly.": "",
		"I have to admit... I did delete some archives from the Outer Space Station.": "",
		"It was too dangerous. So at least I thought. Now I realize that it's safe.": "",
		"Quiax was the one who found out about the safety of this location.": "",
		"The machine on board the station didn't process any 4D matter when getting the data.": "",
		"That's how we found out it was safe.": "",
		"I am a Nomai. Three eyes and some horns and fur. We are known for being an interstellar civilization.": "",
		"Before we got trapped here, though, I had crashed previously on a planet we named Wher.": "",
		"The whole system was extremely weird. Five stars packed tightly together. A strange teleporting moon that was purple.": "",
		"We crashed twice in one trip.": "",
		"I hope I can see my parents soon...": "",
		"Darvy was basically a brother to me. He was a scientist with brilliant ideas, though a little crazy.": "",
		"I remember the day I found out he had died from toying around with 4D matter.": "",
		"I don't have the words to describe it.": "",
		"But I was honored to find out that he wanted me to read his notebook. He always kept it secret.": "",
		"So here I confess: I have know something about the Ghost Moon that everybody else doesn't.": "",
		"Darvy had found out that there is a link between the Ghost Moon and a planet outside of... wherever we are.": "",
		"He found that out in an experiment just before he died. He asked me to build a machine to access that link.": "",
		"And... that's what I did. Darvy was smart, he wrote down all the steps required to build it.": "",
		"Even though I did have to ask Quiax to help a little... I still kept it secret.": "",
		"The building is somewhere on this planet. It harnesses the 4D matter in the core to access the link.": "",
		"Be careful.": "",

		"Why hello there, young creature.": "",
		"What- Who's talking to me?": "",
		"I advise you turn around.": "",
		"What will happen if I don't?": "",
		"Oh, a curious little creature I see.": "",
		"Go on. <![CDATA[<color=purple>Keep walking.</color>]]>": "",
		"Oh... okay...": "",
		"You know, there have been other creatures who have visited before you.": "",
		"Most of them met the same fate.": "",
		"Say, let me catch you up to speed.": "",
		"Here's something from about 250,000 years ago:": "",
		"'NYLOX: Wait, what's happening? Why are the clouds dissapearing?'": "",
		"'QUIAX: Er, I don't know, but it doesn't seem safe.'": "",
		"'WELBAR: Um... Guys, do you see that?'": "",
		"How do you know-": "",
		"'NYLOX: See what!? All I've noticed is that the clouds have dissapeared!'": "",
		"'WELBAR: Uh... look up...'": "",
		"'QUIAX: What the heck is- What- Is that-? Am I-?'": "",
		"'QUIAX: This... this has to be some sort of illusion!'": "",
		"'NYLOX: No, it can't be. We're all seeing it, right?!'": "",
		"'WELBAR: <![CDATA[<color=red>(hyperventilating)</color>]]> THEY'RE COMING FOR US! THE PLANETS ARE ALIVE!'": "",
		"'QUIAX: THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE! WHAT DO WE DO?!'": "",
		"'NYLOX: Okay, everybody stay calm, I have a plan!'": "",
		"Ready for more?": "",
		"No! Don't! I get the story! I get it. What do you want?": "",
		"Those little creatures suffered the fate of my immense power.": "",
		"Their foolish actions led them to my domain.": "",
		"Tampering with the 4th dimension was not, is not, and will NEVER be a good idea.": "",
		"You're lucky I'm keeping you alive.": "",
		"I have a task for you.": "",
		"...What is it?": "",
		"You may have lots of questions, so I'd like to answer them first.": "",
		"<![CDATA[<color=purple>Then I'll make that knowledge go down the drain.</color>]]>": "",
		"Here's your task: There is a time paradox that will break the fabric of the universe at any moment.": "",
		"For some reason, I feel as if I can trust you.": "",
		"You must reset time back to a point. That will prevent the paradox.": "",
		"DO YOU UNDERSTAND?": "",
		"...Yes!": "",
		"Now walk forward. I'll fill you in on the details.": "",
		"Got it.": "",

		// Nomai text spirals and stuff

		"NYLOX: So. I had to make a new journal, because I forgot the one on that sandy planet.": "",
		"NYLOX: Anyways. I am now residing in the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Electrum Tower</color>]]>, so there's that.": "",
		"NYLOX: Oh, and they've done more research on what we've named the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Ghost Moon</color>]]>.": "",
		"NYLOX: Uh... until then, I will be flying to the water planet soon. Scheduled for tomorrow.": "",

		"UBILE: Is it just me, or is a moon forming from that planet's atmosphere?": "",
		"OYVAR: What? That sounds nonsensical. There's no way that a moon can just-": "",
		"OYVAR: Oh. My. Goodness.": "",
		"UBILE: See? It's just... growing. Brown gas from the planet is just being sucked into that moon and getting cooled.": "",
		"OYVAR: Well, I don't know about you, but I think Helioplasmia just spat out all the pieces that fell into it.": "",
		"UBILE: Oh, right. I almost forgot about that. So much hard work gone to waste...": "",

		"KRAK: I feel like this outpost is/should be our main base of operations.": "",
		"NYLOX: What makes you state that?": "",
		"KRAK: Well first let's state the obvious: we almost died on the sandstorm planet. This place is the opposite of that.": "",
		"KRAK: There's literally no wind, the gravity is perfect, and this whole moon is stone and metal.": "",
		"NYLOX: Oh, I see. Hold on, let me write that in my journal...": "",
		"NYLOX: Wait, made out of stone and metal... Could we extract things from here like copper and iron to build a computer of sorts?": "",
		"QUIAX: Hm? Computer you say? I am an expert in those.": "",
		"KRAK: Really? Good to know.": "",
		"NYLOX: That's perfect! Recently, with all the Ghost Moon findings and stuff, I have been dreaming of a concept to get us out of this place.": "",
		"NYLOX: We could forge an Advanced Warp Core and use it to teleport back to Wher.": "",
		"QUIAX: What- Why do we need an advanced one specifically?": "",
		"NYLOX: Uh... because we need lots of power. But this system is also full of radiation.": "",
		"KRAK: Who told you this place is full of radiation?": "",
		"NYLOX: I told myself. I'll have to show you my shoulder once we get to somewhere with oxygen. It's all mutated.": "",
		"NYLOX: We should put it on Zephyria! It's closest to the sun!": "",
		"QUIAX: What!? We almost died there! If you insist, then sure, but it's a bad idea.": "",

		"RERERE: <![CDATA[<color=red>(strange chuckle)</color>]]> So um, we've done research on the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Ghost Moon</color>]]> and uh...": "",
		"RERERE: It has a strange property that we must investigate further.": "",
		"RERERE: I think we can- <![CDATA[<color=red>(obnoxious cough)</color>]]> ...maybe send a ship to it?": "",

		"DARVY: Heh. Get this, the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Ghost Moon</color>]]> is completely mucked up.": "",
		"DARVY: From what we've gathered, it appears as if we need a higher level of technology to investigate.": "",
		"DARVY: Or should I say a <![CDATA[<color=orange>higher dimension</color>]]> of technology.": "",
		"<![CDATA[<color=red>(a pillar can be heard falling)</color>]]>": "",
		"PLOD: Oops... sorry.": "",
		"DARVY: <![CDATA[<color=red>(sigh)</color>]]> Well, anyways, I think we'll have to build <![CDATA[<color=orange>a space base</color>]]> of sorts.": "",
		"DARVY: You know, because of the space. Pun not intended.": "",
		"DARVY: Actually, great idea, we should build the base on that <![CDATA[<color=orange>asteroid orbiting the white gas giant</color>]]>.": "",

		"TROV: Oh wow... This tower is huge!": "",
		"IRNA: No kidding. Say, we really gotta thank the others for saving us from the water planet.": "",
		"TROV: Yeah... Speaking of water planet, there it is now!": "",
		"IRNA: <![CDATA[<color=red>(sarcasm)</color>]]> Oh, wow. I can see it so clearly.": "",
		"TROV: Oh, right. Your vision. Nearsighted.": "",
		"TROV: Aha, so, don't we a have a project to work on?": "",

		"ARVI: I have an idea involving the <![CDATA[<color=orange>white gas giant</color>]]>.": "",
		"BLUH: What is it? Something to do with its gravity?": "",
		"ARVI: Uh, yeah, actually. I was thinking we use the data from the <![CDATA[<color=orange>asteroid base</color>]]> in order to advance further.": "",
		"ARVI: Though I do mourn over <![CDATA[<color=green>his</color>]]> death.": "",
		"BLUH: We all do, Arvi. So, what's this idea of yours?": "",
		"ARVI: Well, it involves building a base <![CDATA[<color=orange>right on the core</color>]]>.": "",

		"NYLOX: Wow... this building is huge.": "",
		"NYLOX: Well I mean that's obvious, but...": "",
		"NYLOX: This library of scrolls and recordings is huge.": "",
		"NYLOX: Might as well read some stuff until my flight to the water planet.": "",
		"NYLOX: It's only three hours from now, so...": "",

		"WELBAR: Am I the only one who hears that humming sound?": "",
		"WELBAR: It sounds strange, but... I wouldn't doubt that it's a black hole.": "",
		"BLUH: Don't be silly, black holes don't make sound. But solid matter does.": "",
		"NYLOX: Uh... no.": "",
		"RERERE: What do you mean? <![CDATA[<color=red>(obnoxious chuckle)</color>]]> I hear nothing!": "",
		"WELBAR: But then this whole moon would be gone by now, wouldn't it?": "",
		"RERERE: Solid as in state of matter! <![CDATA[<color=red>(loud snort and laughter)</color>]]>": "",

		"QUIAX: Uh, what? As far as I know, there should be no interference to have caused that.": "",
		"NYLOX: Perhaps it was from the radiation?": "",
		"QUIAX: It couldn't have been the radiation. Zephyria's magnetic field is strong. Plus, there was that creepy message.": "",
		"OYVAR: Hey everyone! How's the gateway going?": "",
		"QUIAX: Erm... it failed miserably. We need to build another megastructure.": "",
		"OYVAR: Another megastructure?! Remember what happened to the HelioRings?": "",
		"NYLOX: Oh come on, that was only a fluke. We can do better this time.": "",
		"QUIAX: Here's what I have in mind: a <![CDATA[<color=orange>space station out past Teraxia</color>]]>. It will be dedicated space specifically to researching the Ghost Moon. We WILL crack this moon's code!": "",

		"WELBAR: You know what's funny? This moon is tidally locked to the planet it's orbiting.": "",
		"WELBAR: Even crazier is the fact that the planet's clouds are perfectly in sync with this moon's orbit.": "",

		"QUIAX: We- We're safe?": "",
		"QUIAX: We're safe! We aren't dead!": "",
		"NYLOX: Well I guess it worked.": "",
		"WELBAR: Wowee! I didn't think that'd work!": "",
		"QUIAX: This is the final celestial object we have yet to conquer.": "",
		"NYLOX: So shall we get building?": "",
		"WELBAR: Yeah, let's build!": "",
		"NYLOX: Also, I call lead colony supervisor.": "",

		"4-Dimensional Link - Proceed With Caution": "",

		"DARVY: You know what? No. I'm the one who opened that portal. I can do this.": "",
		"DARVY: Let's see here, where's my headlamp? There we go. Now I can see.": "",
		"DARVY: I have no clue where I am. The atmosphere is thick and electrified, though.": "",

		"DARVY: Ow! There's a flipping wall here! Why is it so dense?": "",
		"DARVY: I need to call for back-up. My radio... the radio... Aha!": "",
		"DARVY: Hello? Anybody at base? Anybody?": "",
		"DARVY: Oh no... I'm not getting any response. No static either.": "",
		"DARVY: Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic.": "",

		"<![CDATA[<color=red>(splatter)</color>]]>": "",

		"TROV: Ah! This is a narrow platform on a huge ring suspended less than a kilometer from the surface!": "",
		"TROV: This is dangerous!": "",
		"BLUH: Oh come on, it's not that bad.": "",
		"BLUH: If you're really that scared, just step into one of the buildings. They're glued to the ring, so you'll be 100% safe.": "",
		"TROV: Um... okay.": "",
		"BLUH: Gosh, Trov, we came here to activate the mining lasers and you're scared...": "",

		"ARVI: Wowee! This is amazing!": "",
		"ARVI: At this rate, we'll be able to build anything with all the resources we're gathering!": "",
		"KRAK: Build anything, you say? Think we can build something to finally enter that Ghost Moon?": "",

		"NYLOX: So this is the place where it all happened.": "",
		"NYLOX: Must've been both scary and mesmorizing to watch it shatter into pieces.": "",
		"NYLOX: Just standing here on the edge is terrifying... seeing all the gas looming below me.": "",
		"NYLOX: But I guess that what makes it beautiful.": "",
		"NYLOX: Oh! Right! Stupid me, I have to place the thingy for the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Outer Space Station</color>]]>!": "",

		"Outer Space Station": "",

		"QUIAX: Hey, don't touch that.": "",
		"IRNA: What? Why not?": "",
		"QUIAX: That's the thing that turns this machine on. The extractor is not prepared yet.": "",
		"PLOD: Um, Quiax? What do you mean by 'extractor'?": "",
		"QUIAX: The 'extractor' are those rods attached to the bottom of this thing. Basically, it is what allows us to read data from the 4th dimension.": "",
		"QUIAX: The machine sends the 4D data to a computer on board the station, which uses AI to analyze the data and compress it into 3D data.": "",
		"IRNA: Compress 4D data into 3D data? That makes no sense.": "",
		"QUIAX: Okay, basically, the extractor takes 4D samples from the Ghost Moon, which is highly dangerous. So a machine has to hold the matter in place and remove <![CDATA[<color=orange>all of the dangerous stuff</color>]]> from it.": "",
		"PLOD: Oh, I see! Does the AI read the 3D data outputted to give us information on the Ghost Moon?": "",
		"QUIAX: Basically, yeah.": "",
		"IRNA: So when will it be ready?": "",
		"QUIAX: It'll be ready whenever Welbar decides to get off his darn rear and help me fix the core processor.": "",

		"NYLOX: This place is neat. I like the structure. Feels spacious.": "",
		"NYLOX: Now that Quiax has cracked the code, we'll be off to the Ghost Moon in a matter of days.": "",
		"NYLOX: But the journey is so dangerous... Darvy was killed by messing with 4D matter.": "",
		"NYLOX: Agh, what's wrong with you? They've proven it's safe!": "",
		"NYLOX: You know what? I'm going to <![CDATA[<color=hide the code in pieces around this system.></color>]]>. I'll put the pieces in places so <![CDATA[<color=orange>obvious you'd overlook them</color>]]>.": "",
		"NYLOX: That way nobody will make the journey.": "",
		"NYLOX: Let's see here, <![CDATA[<color=orange>'ADFBEC'</color>]]>. That'll work wonders.": "",

		"QUIAX: Guys, come quick! The results are in!": "",
		"WELBAR: Well, what is it?": "",
		"KRAK: What do the results say?": "",
		"NYLOX: I'm excited to hear this.": "",
		"TROV: The tension is insane!": "",
		"QUIAX: Okay, this is going to sound crazy. But out of every single test we ran on the Ghost Moon, one piece of information stuck out.": "",
		"KRAK: Well, what is it?": "",

		"TROV: We have houses, agriculture, and a crude mining site, though it doesn't pull out much.": "",
		"OYVAR: Ah yes, that's it! We could go to that moon above us and mine there! Chances are, it has lots of metal.": "",
		"TROV: Good thinking as always, Oyvar! Let's get started.": "",

		"WELBAR: Gosh darn it, just when I thought we were onto something.": "",
		"WELBAR: The stupid vessel went all crazy and sent our escape pod flying into space, when suddenly we teleport and end up here.": "",
		"IRNA: You know, Welbar, I think we weren't the only escape pod to crash.": "",
		"WELBAR: How so?": "",
		"IRNA: I may have caught a glimpse of another pod as we were teleporting.": "",
		"WELBAR: Well gosh digity dangit, I guess we have to-": "",
		"QUIAX: Hey guys, do you see that?": "",
		"QUIAX: There's an escape pod crashing on that <![CDATA[<color=orange>desert planet</color>]]>!": "",

		"DARVY: At last! We've finally finished the construction of the Geothermal Dynamo Generator!": "",
		"DARVY: Thanks to the help of Quiax's sister Plod and the master builder Trov, of course. I only came up with the idea.": "",
		"DARVY: Uh, nonetheless, this thing is supposed to be powered by the tidal forces exerted by what we've named Teraxia.": "",
		"DARVY: Both that and geothermal activity. Anyways, that's besides the point.": "",
		"DARVY: Today I activate the machine that will be our first steps into the <![CDATA[<color=orange>fourth dimension</color>]]>!": "",
		"DARVY: If this all goes well, we'll be able to conquer the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Ghost Moon</color>]]>!": "",
		"DARVY: It may also confirm some of my suspicions. But I should mention this is dangerous, toying around with 4D matter. So if I don't come out alive,": "",

		"DARVY: Well ringdingding my rear, we've managed to crash TWICE in less than 3 months! What kind of sick luck is this?": "",
		"BLUH: Dunno but- <![CDATA[<color=red>(heavy wind sounds)</color>]]> Ow, shards! Ah, my suit is tearing apart!": "",
		"DARVY: What on Dyseria is this place? My suit fabric is- <![CDATA[<color=red>(heavy clang)</color>]]> Fudge! My helmet!": "",
		"<![CDATA[<color=red>(other Nomai yelling in despair)</color>]]>": "",
		"ARVI: We need to build shelter immediately!": "",
		"BLUH: Yeah, no kidding! Wait, woah! Woah! <![CDATA[<color=red>(hard impact on the floor)</color>]]>": "",

		"NYLOX: It's been four days since the crash, and we're running out of supplies. Namely, oxygen. They've gone so far as to plant all the tree seeds they have.": "",
		"NYLOX: I'm using this as a journal for anybody to find if we die. I feel bad for anybody else unfortunate enough to crash here.": "",
		"NYLOX: Over the past few days, the rest of us Nomai have been trying to build shelter to no avail.": "",
		"NYLOX: Over that time, we've occasionally seen a slightly-green tinted moon that tends to 'wander about'. It's nothing like that <![CDATA[<color=purple>Quantum Lean.</color>]]>": "",
		"NYLOX: Anyways, where was I? Right. The top of the tribe are devising a building three-layers thick, and four stories high, that will house all of us.": "",
		"NYLOX: It's our only hope. I'll update my journal if I come out of this... not dead.": "",

		"KRAK: We did it! We're saved!": "",
		"UBILE: Not yet. <![CDATA[<color=red>(shouting)</color>]]> Everybody, get inside the building!": "",
